# What is This? #

It's a nodejs module, that defines a single class to represent a 2d array like so:

```
[[ 1 , 2 ...
   3 , 4 ...
   ......... ]]
```

Where numbers increase from left to right and from top to bottom.

The class implements some functions, two of which are puzzleworthy:

 * `findNumber (num)` : finds the [i,j] index of "num" in the square
 * `findNthSmallest (n)` : finds the nth smallest number in the square

 Super useful.
